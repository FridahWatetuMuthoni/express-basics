# Express Notes

## Methods

### express.json()

express.json([options])

This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.
Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.
A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.
